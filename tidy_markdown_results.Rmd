### Methods

#### Study Selection

This review was completed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines [@Moher2009]. Inclusion criteria and methods for analyses were prespecified and documented in a preregistered protocol {r} [https://osf.io/fykum] on January 6, 2021, publically available on the OSF (Open Science Framework). PubMed was searched from inception to January 6, 2021, according to the following search algorithm: ("neuromelanin" OR "qMRI" OR "hMRI") AND (MRI)) AND ("schizophrenia" OR "schizophrenic" OR "psychosis"). A total of 9 entries on PubMed and 2 additional studies, known to the authors were screened. Seven studies were found to be eligible and evaulated using the Newcastleâ€“ Ottawa Scale (NOS) for assessing the quality of non-randomized studies in meta-analysis [@Wells2014].

```{r fig2, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.cap = "Flowchart: Study extraction"}


knitr::include_graphics("figures/Flowchart_qMRI.png")


```

#### Meta-analysis

Novelty of the method and scarcety of eligible studies prevented an a priori estimate of heterogeneity. Therefore, a random-effects, as well as a fixed-effects model were calculated and compared. Hedge's g and DerSimonian-Laird estimator for &tau; were used for calculating pooled effect sizes while taking variance into account. Since there were only 7 studies available in totl, no subgroup analyses were conducted, according to the standard criterion [@Borenstein2013].

#### Meta-regression

Meta-regression analyses for publication year and mean age across both groups was calculated to estimate the effect of moderating variables on effect sizes between studies. Hedge's g and DerSimonian-Laird estimator for &tau; were used for calculating pooled effect sizes while taking variance into account.

#### Meta-analysis of variance

To account for different level of heterogeneity between groups the variance ratios were calculated.  The coefficient of variation ratio (CVR) is the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation from two groups. It takes the interdependence of group mean and standard deviation into account [@Nakagawa2015].

The statistical software R (version 3.6.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) with the meta package (insert package citation) for meta-analysis of effect size and with the metafor package (insert package citation) for meta-analysis of variance was used to analyse all data.

```{r recomputeYamashita, include=F}

# calculate sd from interquartil range
# assuming that data is normally distributed mean = median
# https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/256456/how-to-calculate-mean-and-standard-deviation-from-median-and-quartiles

# first for HC
q1 <- data_qmri$HCmean[5] - data_qmri$HCsd[5]/2
q3 <- data_qmri$HCmean[5] + data_qmri$HCsd[5]/2
n <- data_qmri$HCn[5]

# replace in qMRI
data_qmri$HCsd[5] <- (q3 - q1) / (2 * (qnorm((0.75 * n - 0.125) / (n + 0.25))))

# then for SZ
q1 <- data_qmri$SZmean[5] - data_qmri$SZsd[5]/2
q3 <- data_qmri$SZmean[5] + data_qmri$SZsd[5]/2
n <- data_qmri$SZn[5]

# replace in qMRI
data_qmri$SZsd[5] <- (q3 - q1) / (2 * (qnorm((0.75 * n - 0.125) / (n + 0.25))))
```

### Results excluding Yamashita (2016)

```{r resul_cr, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 12, include=T,echo=F}
#exclude Yamashita - did the other authors all report CR values??

resul_cr<- metacont(SZn, SZmean, SZsd, HCn, HCmean, HCsd, data = data_qmri_cr, sm="SMD", method.smd = "Hedges", studlab = Autor)
print(resul_cr)

forest_cr <- forest(resul_cr, lab.e = "Patients with schizophrenia", lab.c = "Healthy controls")

```

The fixed effects model suggests significant differences between between patients and controls in mean estimates for neuromelanine content in the substantia nigra (SN) (d=``r resul$TE.random``[``r resul$lower.random``; ``r resul$upper.random``], z=``r resul$zval.fixed``, p=``r resul$pval.fixed``, see Figure x). Including only studies where contrast ratios of signal intensity from SN and white matter (locus ceruleus) were available, the effect remained significant (d=``r resul_cr$TE.random``[``r resul_cr$lower.random``; ``r resul_cr$upper.random``], z=``r resul_cr$zval.fixed``, p=``r resul_cr$pval.fixed``, see Figure x).

The random effects model revealed no difference between patients and controls in mean estimates (d=``r resul$TE.random``[``r resul$lower.random``; ``r resul$upper.random``], z=``r resul$zval.random``, p=``r resul$pval.random``, see Figure x). However, the group effect was rendered significant when including only studies with contrast rations available (d=``r resul_cr$TE.random``[``r resul_cr$lower.random``; ``r resul_cr$upper.random``], z=``r resul_cr$zval.random``, p=``r resul_cr$pval.random``, see Figure x)

The test for heterogeneity between studies shows a low amount of heterogeneity ($\tau^2$=``r resul$tau^2``, $I^2$=``r resul$I2*100``%) according to established standards [@Higgins2002].

### Funnel Plot Asymmetry

Visual inspection and formal testing for bias according to [@Egger1997] revealed no significant source of bias

```{r resul_metabias, include=T,echo=F}
resul_metabias<-regtest(x=resul$TE, sei=resul$seTE, model="lm") # "sei" for the standard error
print(resul_metabias)

# draw a funnel plot with missing studies filled in, in our case none
resul_trimfill<-trimfill(resul_cr)
funnel(resul_trimfill, legend=TRUE)

#Studies are defined as outliers when their 95% confidence interval lies ouside the 95% confidence interval of the pooled effect.
find.outliers(resul)
find.outliers(resul_cr)

```


### Meta-regression

```{r metareg, include=T, echo=F}

resul_metareg_y<-metareg(resul_cr, year)
resul_metareg_a<-metareg(resul_cr, age_mean)

# here age difference in a metareg does not make sense since we have a matched sample and differences should be 0
# only thing that would make sense as a metaregression: interaction of age (across all studies) with group and outcome ES

# does strength of already found effect in each group between age and CR differ between groups? (this analysis also controls for correct matching)
# lm: CR = age*group -> interaction significant? OR t-test between correlation coefficients

# reshape data into long format
longdat.qmri <- melt(data_qmri_cr,
                           # ID variables - all the variables to keep but not split apart on
                           id.vars=c("Autor","age_mean"),
                           # The source columns
                           measure.vars=c("HCmean","SZmean"),
                           # Name of the destination column that will identify the original
                           # column that the measurement came from
                           variable.name="group",
                           value.name="CR"
)


#mod <- lmer(CR~(1|Autor)*age_mean*group, data=longdat.qmri)

bubble.y <- bubble(metareg(resul_cr, year),xlim = c(2005,2025), ylim=c(-0.9,1), bg = "transparent", ylab = "effect size", xlab="year of publication", cex.lab=1.5, lty = 1,
       lwd = 1,
       col.line = "blue", regline = TRUE, studlab = TRUE, pos.studlab = 1, offset = 1)
bubble.y 

bubble.a <- bubble(metareg(resul_cr, age_mean),xlim = c(15,50),ylim=c(-0.2,0.7), bg = "transparent", ylab = "effect size", xlab="age", cex.lab=1.5, lty = 1,
       lwd = 1,
       col.line = "blue", regline = TRUE, studlab = TRUE, pos.studlab = 1, offset = 1)
bubble.a 

```

### CVR
```{r cvr, fig.height = 6, fig.width =12, include=T, echo = F}

cvar_ratio<-data_qmri_cr%>%
  escalc("CVR", n1i=SZn, m1i=SZmean, sd1i=SZsd, n2i=HCn, m2i=HCmean, sd2i=HCsd, data=., append = T)

#resul_var_ratio<-rma.uni(cvar_ratio, measure = "VR", slab=data_qmri_cr$Autor)

##double check: calculation of VR manually
#log(data_qmri$SZsd/data_qmri$HCsd)+((1/((2*data_qmri$SZn)-1))-(1/((2*data_qmri$HCn)-1)))

resul_cvar_ratio<-rma.uni(cvar_ratio, measure = "CVR", slab=data_qmri_cr$Autor)
forest_plot<-forest.rma(resul_cvar_ratio, slab=data_qmri_cr$Autor, showweights=TRUE, top=2)
text(forest_plot[["xlim"]][1],length(forest_plot[["rows"]])+2, "Study", pos=4)
text(forest_plot[["xlim"]][2]-2.5,length(forest_plot[["rows"]])+2,"Weight", pos=4)
text(forest_plot[["xlim"]][2],length(forest_plot[["rows"]])+2, "Log CVR [95% CI]", pos=2)
text(-2.4,-1.7,"greater variability in controls")
text(2.4,-1.7,"greater variability in patients")
### add text with Q-value, dfs, p-value, and I^2 statistic
text(forest_plot[["xlim"]][1]+1, 2, pos=1, cex=1, bquote(paste("(Q = ",.(formatC(resul_cvar_ratio$QE, digits=2, format="f")), ", df = ", .(resul_cvar_ratio$k - resul_cvar_ratio$p),", p = ", .(formatC(resul_cvar_ratio$QEp, digits=2, format="f")), "; ", I^2, " = ",.(formatC(resul_cvar_ratio$I2, digits=1, format="f")), "%)")))

##test for effects of age and publication year on CVR

# age is not significant
res.age <- rma.uni(cvar_ratio$yi, cvar_ratio$vi, mods = ~ cvar_ratio$age_mean)
res.age

# year is significant
res.year <- rma.uni(cvar_ratio$yi, cvar_ratio$vi, mods = ~ cvar_ratio$year)
res.year
```

To control for possible further sources of variance, we conducted random-effects meta-regression. Publication year showed no significant moderating effect (QM=``r resul_metareg_y$QM``, p=``r resul_metareg_y$pval[2]``, see eFigure 7). Age of the investigated subjects did also show no significant moderating effect QM=``r resul_metareg_a$QM``, p=``r resul_metareg_a$pval[2]`` see eFigure 8).


### Post-hoc Power Analysis
```{r power-analysis, include=T, echo = F}

# this gives us power slightly below 0.8 (only if excluding Yamashita)

pa_cr <- power.analysis(d = resul_cr$TE.random, k = 6, n1 =mean(data_qmri_cr$HCn), n2 = mean(data_qmri_cr$SZn), heterogeneity = "moderate")
pa_cr


```



Post-hoc power analysis revealed a power of ``r pa_cr$Power``.
