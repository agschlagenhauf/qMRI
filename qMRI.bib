   abstract = {Background: It has been hypothesized that dopamine function in schizophrenia exhibits heterogeneity in excess of that seen in the general population. However, no previous study has systematically tested this hypothesis. Methods: We employed meta-analysis of variance to investigate interindividual variability of striatal dopaminergic function in patients with schizophrenia and in healthy control subjects. We included 65 studies that reported molecular imaging measures of dopamine synthesis or release capacities, dopamine D2/3 receptor (D2/3R) or dopamine transporter (DAT) availabilities, or synaptic dopamine levels in 983 patients and 968 control subjects. Variability differences were quantified using variability ratio (VR) and coefficient of variation ratio. Results: Interindividual variability of striatal D2/3R (VR = 1.26, p <.0001) and DAT (VR = 1.31, p =.01) availabilities and synaptic dopamine levels (VR = 1.38, p =.045) but not dopamine synthesis (VR = 1.12, p =.13) or release (VR = 1.08, p =.70) capacities were significantly greater in patients than in control subjects. Findings were robust to variability measure. Mean dopamine synthesis (g = 0.65, p =.004) and release (g = 0.66, p =.03) capacities, as well as synaptic levels (g = 0.78, p =.0006), were greater in patients overall, but mean synthesis capacity did not differ from that of control subjects in treatment-resistant patients (p >.3). Mean D2/3R (g = 0.17, p =.14) and DAT (g = -0.20, p =.28) availabilities did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate significant heterogeneity of striatal dopamine function in schizophrenia. They suggest that while elevated dopamine synthesis and release capacities may be core features of the disorder, altered D2/3R and DAT availabilities and synaptic dopamine levels may occur only in a subgroup of patients. This heterogeneity may contribute to variation in treatment response and side effects.},

   abstract = {The diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) occurs after pathogenesis is advanced and many substantia nigra (SN) dopamine neurons have already died. Now that therapies to block this neuronal loss are under development, it is imperative that the disease be diagnosed at earlier stages and that the response to therapies is monitored. Recent studies suggest this can be accomplished by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detection of neuromelanin (NM), the characteristic pigment of SN dopaminergic, and locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons. NM is an autophagic product synthesized via oxidation of catecholamines and subsequent reactions, and in the SN and LC it increases linearly during normal aging. In PD, however, the pigment is lost when SN and LC neurons die. As shown nearly 25 years ago by Zecca and colleagues, NM’s avid binding of iron provides a paramagnetic source to enable electron and nuclear magnetic resonance detection, and thus a means for safe and noninvasive measure in living human brain. Recent technical improvements now provide a means for MRI to differentiate between PD patients and age-matched healthy controls, and should be able to identify changes in SN NM with age in individuals. We discuss how MRI detects NM and how this approach might be improved. We suggest that MRI of NM can be used to confirm PD diagnosis and monitor disease progression. We recommend that for subjects at risk for PD, and perhaps generally for older people, that MRI sequences performed at regular intervals can provide a pre-clinical means to detect presymptomatic PD.},

   abstract = {Computational modeling plays an important role in modern neuroscience research. Much previous research has relied on statistical methods, separately, to address two problems that are actually interdependent. First, given a particular computational model, Bayesian hierarchical techniques have been used to estimate individual variation in parameters over a population of subjects, leveraging their population-level distributions. Second, candidate models are themselves compared, and individual variation in the expressed model estimated, according to the fits of the models to each subject. The interdependence between these two problems arises because the relevant population for estimating parameters of a model depends on which other subjects express the model. Here, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework for concurrent model comparison, parameter estimation and inference at the population level, combining previous approaches. We show that this framework has important advantages for both parameter estimation and model comparison theoretically and experimentally. The parameters estimated by the HBI show smaller errors compared to other methods. Model comparison by HBI is robust against outliers and is not biased towards overly simplistic models. Furthermore, the fully Bayesian approach of our theory enables researchers to make inference on group-level parameters by performing HBI t-test.},

This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the X2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of H that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {Summary: Meta-analysis has become a standard way of summarizing empirical studies in many fields, including ecology and evolution. In ecology and evolution, meta-analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means, using standardized metrics such as Cohen's / Hedges' d or the response ratio. However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but also the variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two groups may be informative, especially when a treatment influences the variance in addition to or instead of the mean. In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic lnCVR (the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation, CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta-analytically compare differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use of lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution. Further, as an alternative approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose the combined use of ln s (the log standard deviation) and lnx- (the log mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed) model. The use of ln s with lnx- overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and it provides a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation beyond two-group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use of ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis. Our approaches to compare variability could be applied to already published meta-analytic data sets that compare two-group means to uncover potentially overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally, our approaches should be applied to future meta-analyses, especially when one suspects a treatment has an effect not only on the mean, but also on the variance. Notably, the application of the proposed methods extends beyond the fields of ecology and evolution.},

   abstract = {Background: To date, there is no systematic overview of glutamate in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of patients with schizophrenia. Here, we meta-analyzed case-control studies of high-field proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) investigating glutamate in DLPFC. Additionally, we estimated variance ratios to investigate homo/heterogeneity. Methods: Preregistration of the study was performed on September 20, 2019. The predefined literature search on PubMed comprised articles with search terms (magnetic resonance spectroscopy OR MRS) AND (glutamate OR glut∗ OR GLX) AND (schizophrenia OR psychosis OR schizophren∗). Meta-analyses with a fixed- and random-effects model with inverse variance method, DerSimonian-Laird estimator for τ2, and Cohen's d were calculated. For differences in variability, we calculated a random-effects model for measures of variance ratios. The primary study outcome was the difference in glutamate in the DLPFC in cases versus controls. Secondary outcomes were differences in variability. Results: The quantitative analysis comprised 429 cases and 365 controls. Overall, we found no group difference (d = 0.03 [95% confidence interval (CI), −0.20 to 0.26], z = 0.28, p = .78). Sensitivity analysis revealed an effect for medication status (Q = 8.35, p = .039), i.e., increased glutamate in antipsychotic-naïve patients (d = 0.46 [95% CI, 0.08 to 0.84], z = 2.37, p = .018). Concerning variance ratios, we found an effect of medication status (Q = 16.95, p < .001) due to lower coefficient of variation ratio (CVR) in medication-naïve patients (logCVR = −0.49 [95% CI, −0.78 to −0.20], z = −3.33, p < .001). In studies with medicated patients, we found higher CVR (logCVR = 0.22 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.39], z = 2.67; p = .008). Conclusions: We carefully interpret the higher levels and lower variability in cortical glutamate in antipsychotic-naïve patients as a possible key factor resulting from a putative allostatic mechanism. We conclude that care has to be taken when evaluating metabolite levels in clinical samples in which medication might confound findings.},

   abstract = {Objective: To determine the diagnostic performance of neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging discriminating between patients with Parkinson’s disease and normal healthy controls and to identify factors causing heterogeneity influencing the diagnostic performance. Methods: A systematic literature search in the Ovid-MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed for studies reporting the relevant topic before February 17, 2020. The pooled sensitivity and specificity values with their 95% confidence intervals were calculated using bivariate random-effects modeling. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were also performed to determine factors influencing heterogeneity. Results: Twelve articles including 403 patients with Parkinson’s disease and 298 control participants were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging showed a pooled sensitivity of 89% (95% confidence interval, 86–92%) and a pooled specificity of 83% (95% confidence interval, 76–88%). In the subgroup and meta-regression analysis, a disease duration longer than 5 and 10 years, comparisons using measured volumes instead of signal intensities, a slice thickness in terms of magnetic resonance imaging parameters of more than 2 mm, and semi-/automated segmentation methods instead of manual segmentation improved the diagnostic performance. Conclusion: Neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging had a favorable diagnostic performance in discriminating patients with Parkinson’s disease from healthy controls. To improve diagnostic accuracy, further investigations directly comparing these heterogeneity-affecting factors and optimizing these parameters are necessary. Key Points: • Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI favorably discriminates patients with Parkinson’s disease from healthy controls. • Disease duration, parameters used for comparison, magnetic resonance imaging slice thickness, and segmentation methods affected heterogeneity across the studies.},

   abstract = {During aging, neuronal organelles filled with neuromelanin (a dark-brown pigment) and lipid bodies accumulate in the brain, particularly in the substantia nigra, a region targeted in Parkinson’s disease. We have investigated protein and lipid systems involved in the formation of these organelles and in the synthesis of the neuromelanin of human substantia nigra. Membrane and matrix proteins characteristic of lysosomes were found in neuromelanin-containing organelles at a lower number than in typical lysosomes, indicating a reduced enzymatic activity and likely impaired capacity for lysosomal and autophagosomal fusion. The presence of proteins involved in lipid transport may explain the accumulation of lipid bodies in the organelle and the lipid component in neuromelanin structure. The major lipids observed in lipid bodies of the organelle are dolichols with lower amounts of other lipids. Proteins of aggregation and degradation pathways were present, suggesting a role for accumulation by this organelle when the ubiquitin-proteasome system is inadequate. The presence of proteins associated with aging and storage diseases may reflect impaired autophagic degradation or impaired function of lysosomal enzymes. The identification of typical autophagy proteins and double membranes demonstrates the organelle’s autophagic nature and indicates that it has engulfed neuromelanin precursors from the cytosol. Based on these data, it appears that the neuromelanin-containing organelle has a very slow turnover during the life of a neuron and represents an intracellular compartment of final destination for numerous molecules not degraded by other systems.},

In ecology and evolution, meta-analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means, using standardized metrics such as Cohen's / Hedges' d or the response ratio. However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but also the variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two groups may be informative, especially when a treatment influences the variance in addition to or instead of the mean. In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic lnCVR (the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation, CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta-analytically compare differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use of lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution. Further, as an alternative approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose the combined use of ln s (the log standard deviation) and lnx- (the log mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed) model. The use of ln s with lnx- overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and it provides a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation beyond two-group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use of ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis. Our approaches to compare variability could be applied to already published meta-analytic data sets that compare two-group means to uncover potentially overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally, our approaches should be applied to future meta-analyses, especially when one suspects a treatment has an effect not only on the mean, but also on the variance. Notably, the application of the proposed methods extends beyond the fields of ecology and evolution.},

   abstract = {Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI) purports to detect the content of neuromelanin (NM), a product of dopamine metabolism that accumulates with age in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra (SN). Interindividual variability in dopamine function may result in varying levels of NM accumulation in the SN; however, the ability of NM-MRI to measure dopamine function in nonneurodegenerative conditions has not been established. Here, we validated that NM-MRI signal intensity in postmortem midbrain specimens correlated with regional NM concentration even in the absence of neurodegeneration, a prerequisite for its use as a proxy for dopamine function. We then validated a voxelwise NM-MRI approach with sufficient anatomical sensitivity to resolve SN subregions. Using this approach and a multimodal dataset of molecular PET and fMRI data, we further showed the NM-MRI signal was related to both dopamine release in the dorsal striatum and resting blood flow within the SN. These results suggest that NM-MRI signal in the SN is a proxy for function of dopamine neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. As a proof of concept for its clinical utility, we show that the NM-MRI signal correlated to severity of psychosis in schizophrenia and individuals at risk for schizophrenia, consistent with the well-established dysfunction of the nigrostriatal pathway in psychosis. Our results indicate that noninvasive NMMRI is a promising tool that could have diverse research and clinical applications to investigate in vivo the role of dopamine in neuropsychiatric illness.},

   abstract = {The ventral tegmental area (VTA), one of the neuromelanincontaining dopaminergic nuclei in the midbrain, is closely related to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, but its imaging findings remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether neuromelanin-sensitive MRI can detect alterations in the signals of the VTA of patients with schizophrenia. Neuromelanin-sensitive T1-weighted images at 3 T were obtained in 14 patients with schizophrenia and 22 healthy individuals. After signal inhomogeneity correction, brain signal rescaling of the images, and spatial normalization, signal intensity of the VTA and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) was automatically measured using the regions-of-interest constructed from the images of the healthy individuals. The normalized signal intensity of the VTA in patients with schizophrenia (median± quartile deviation, 998 ± 10) was significantly decreased compared with that in healthy controls (1018 ±15) (P=0.010), whereas that of the SNc was not significantly different between the groups (1093 ± 6 and 1098± 10, respectively, P=0.84). The VTA/SNc ratio was also significantly lower in patients with schizophrenia (0.916 ±0.007) than in the control participants (0.934± 0.010) (P=0.010). In addition, the scores of the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms showed an independent negative correlation with VTA signaling (r=-0.69, P=0.012). Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI enables direct visualization of the selective signal attenuation in the VTA, which was correlated with positive symptoms, in patients with schizophrenia.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The dopamine hypothesis suggests that excessive dopamine release results in the symptoms of schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons using 3-T neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with schizophrenia and healthy control subjects. Methods: We prospectively examined 52 patients with schizophrenia (M: F = 27:25, mean age, 35 years) and age- and sexmatched healthy controls. Using a 3T MRI unit, we obtained oblique T1-weighted axial images perpendicular to the brainstem. We measured the signal intensity and area for the substantia nigra (SNc), midbrain tegmentum, locus ceruleus (LC), and pons. We then calculated the contrast ratios (CR) for the SNc (CRSN) and LC (CRLC ), which were compared between patients and healthy controls using unpaired t-tests. Results: The SNc and LC were readily identified in both patients and healthy controls as areas with high signal intensities in the posterior part of the cerebral peduncle and in the upper pontine tegmentum. The CRSN values in patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (10.89±2.37 vs. 9.6±2.36, p<0.01). We observed no difference in the CRLC values between the patients and healthy controls (14.21±23.5 vs. 13.44±3.37, p = 0.25). Furthermore, there was no difference in area of the SNc and LC between schizophrenia patients and controls. Conclusions: Neuromelanin MRI might reveal increased signal intensity in the SNc of patients with schizophrenia. Our results indicate the presence of excessive dopamine products in the SNc of these patients. © 2014 Watanabe et al.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Fast spin-echo (FSE) T1-weighted (T1W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3T, which is sensitive to neuromelanin-related contrast, can quantitatively detect signal alterations in the locus ceruleus (LC) and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of depressive and schizophrenic patients; however, its qualitative diagnostic performance remains unknown. We investigated whether visual interpretation of semiquantitative color maps can be used for discriminating between depressive and schizophrenic patients and healthy individuals. Methods: We retrospectively examined 23 patients with major depression, 23 patients with schizophrenia, and 23 age-matched healthy controls by using a FSE-T1W MRI technique. Semiquantitative color maps of sections through the LC and SNc were visually interpreted by nine raters using a continuous confidence rating scale for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: The area under the ROC curve (Az), which reflects the performance in differentiating between depressive patients and controls, was 0.88, and the sensitivity and specificity at the maximum likelihood were 76% and 83%, respectively. In contrast, the Az value, sensitivity, and specificity values between schizophrenics and controls and between depressives and schizophrenics were 0.66 and 0.69, 42% and 48%, and 82% and 84%, respectively. Conclusion: Semiquantitative, color-coded FSE-T1W MRI at 3T can be used for visually differentiating depressive patients from healthy individuals with a substantially high likelihood, but this technique cannot be applied to distinguish schizophrenic patients from the other two groups. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},
